To compile the C code to a executable you will need gcc installed.
gcc is the c compiler, and the command is:
  gcc exploit.c
this will produse a.out file tht is executable with ./a.out.
You can use the option -o <outputn name> to choose the output name

example:
gcc exploit.c -o exploit -fno-stack-protector
Here we also add the -fno-stack-protector option,
so that it will take away the protection for the memory stack.
