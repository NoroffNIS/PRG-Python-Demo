I have a problem
I decide to bring it to stack overflow
I awkwardly write down my question
I realize that the question doesn't make any sense
I take 15 minutes to rethink how to ask my question
I realize that I'm attacking the problem from a wrong direction entirely.
I start from scratch and find my solution quickly.
